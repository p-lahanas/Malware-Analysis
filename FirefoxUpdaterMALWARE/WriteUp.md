# **Firefox Updater... supposedly**

## Background
One simple google search the other day resulted in a drive-by download on my machine. Rather than delete the file and move on with my life, I thought it would be fun to investigate the mysterious "Firefox.Quick.Update.ver.102.40.91878.js" that appeared on my system. I've never really analysed malware before but anyway, here we go. 

## First Impressions
For those of you playing along at home, the original javascript file is included in this directory and is title "Firefox.Quick.Update.ver.102.40.91878.js". I have removed the sketchy URL so that no one gets hurt and replaced it with the text "THE SKETCHY URL". 

First thing is I wanted to rule out that this might be a legitimate update so I opened the document in my trusty text editor. Yep, something is a bit suss here as I see some attempts at obfuscation. My next thought process is to see if VirusTotal has any insight.
